My time spent in Vietnam was a culinary adventure. 
Nothing was more exciting than the day I got to try Balut.
Balut is a vietnames delicacy, it is a fertilized egg,
usually duck or quail, and is eaten in a brothy soup with leafy greens
or with french bread and a spicy chili sauce. The eggs are 
incubated for a period of 14 to 21 days and then boiled of steamed.

I was introduced to this food by two friends I had met during my travels 
through thailand. They both resided in Da Nang, Vietnam.
They took me to a small restaurant where they introduced me to the dish.
As we ate they explained to me the tradition of eating Balut.

 >many families eat this dish, however they often choose to eat it in the dark so as to not see the small duck that has grown inside. 

I understood why this was, it was difficult to look at. I closed my eyes, took a big bite. To my delight it just tasted like the most delicious hard boiled egg!
